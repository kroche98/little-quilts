    <h1>Kevin's Little Quilt Implementation</h1>
    
    <p>This is my implementation using JavaScript of Ravi Seth's "Little Quilt" toy language. Every object in Little Quilt is a "quilt" with a width, a height, and a pattern. Little Quilt has two primitive objects: "a" and "b", each of which is a 1x1 quilt. Little Quilt also has two primitive operations: "turn", which rotates a quilt 90 degrees clockwise, and "sew", which joins one quilt to another quilt of the same height. All quilts can be built out of these primitives.</p>
