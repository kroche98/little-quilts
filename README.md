# Little Quilts Implementation

This web application is based on the "Little Quilts" language by Ravi Sethi. The two base quilts can be manipulated and combined to create more complex quilts on the canvas.

## Operations

- Save: saves the quilt on the canvas for future use
- Turn: rotate the quilt on the canvas 90 degrees clockwise
- Sew: sew two quilts together horizontally (quilts must be of the same height)
- Unturn: rotate the quilt on the canvas 90 degrees counterclockwise
- Pinwheel: join 4 copies of the current quilt, each rotated 90 degrees successively (quilt must be square)
- Pile: sew two quilts together vertically (quilts must be of the same width)
- Tile: tile the quilt on the canvas with specified dimensions

## TODO

- More intuitive interface
- Button to save quilt as image
